RAVDESS DATASET

README:

Instructions for setup:

1) Download the dataset from the following link:
https://zenodo.org/record/1188976#.YFZuJ0j7SL8

2) Make sure to choose the Audio Speech Dataset and not the Audio Song Dataset. 

3) Once downloaded, extract and move folder to working directory. 

4) Run the files main_2aug.py for generating a CNN model, main_lstm.py for generating the LSTM model and main_rnn.py for generating the RNN model. 

5) The py scripts use generalized path and path seperators thorughout the code and should work across platforms.
